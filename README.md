#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the first stage of the **Restaurant Reviews** project I converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. I added accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

### Specification

I was provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code had a lot of issues. It was barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also didn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it didn’t work offline at all. My job was to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality. 

### Set Up

1. Run a local server from the computer's terminal using a `live-server` npm package with the following setup:
    ```live-server --port=8000 --host=localhost```

2. With the server running, the site can be viewed on `http://localhost:8000`

3. All changes in the code are displayed automatically in the browser
